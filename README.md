## Basics_Project_in_Jupyter_Beginning.ipynb

This small file was just to to look around and get a feel of `Jupyter Notebook` , I opened a file, made a table and played around with code cells and markdown cells and understood the shortcuts of Jupyter Notebook and got the hang of Markdown references.

## Data analysis of GooglePlay and Appstore Project 1

This project contains alot of python coding without any important libraries such as Pandas or Numphy. This analysis was done using the basic python to understand all the processes of what is happening before using any libraries to cut short that process. I was
able to understand the logics used in Data analysis in this project, and working with real-life datasets is always fun! Here's a breif Introduction of what I did in the project:

`Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our
team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.`

`At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app.
Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.`

### Conclusion

`Above, We can see that e-readers and dictionaries are popular in googleplay store, SO we can tell there is still market for these. However, if we make a simple app that is similar to thousands of apps that are already in the market, 
We might not achieve anything with that. So our idea of doing something different by making an app that let's us read books and recommends songs based on the book,we can also add an in built player with a saved playlist for some really
popular books, and let users add their own choices onto that list. Since We want to keep our app free, buiyng the license for the songs can be expensive and out of budget, so we can give them an option to connect our app to their Spotify,
like Discord. We can also include some options like discussion forums and quizzes on books to make it more interactive.`

The conclusion above was for Google Play aand  The conclusion that I found after doing the analyis on both AppStore and Google Play was:

`In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.`

`We concluded that making an app that is an advanced verion of e-reader, with music recommendations of each book, and options to connect it to spotify for better user 
experience can be a good idea. We can include Discussion Forums and quizes on the books to make the app more interactive.`
